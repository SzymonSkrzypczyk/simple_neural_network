# Simple Neural Network

## About
It's a simple implementation of Neural Network created using Kotlin 

## Why?
The main reason is my curiosity about Kotlin notebooks, as well as will for learning as much details about ANN as possible. At the moment the project is not completed and most probably won't be for a couple of next weeks/months, but who knows :)

## TBD 
- Implementation of ANN allowing for flexible training input
- A few working examples on real data
- And more...
